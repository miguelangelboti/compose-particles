# Particles with Jetpack Compose
In "airplane mode" during a flight, what better than developing an experimental app with animations in Compose?
## Overview
This is an experimental app showcasing an animated particle canvas using Jetpack Compose. Particles move and respond to user gestures, creating an interactive and visually appealing experience.

## Features
- **Animated Particles**: Displays a canvas with particles that change color and position over time.
- **Interactive Gestures**: Users can interact with the particles by tapping and dragging on the canvas. These gestures are handled using custom Modifier extensions for `detectDragGestures` and `detectTapGestures`.
- **Jetpack Compose**: Built entirely with Jetpack Compose.
